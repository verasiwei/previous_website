    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Here are some notes for basic medicine knowledge that would help me understand the medicine problem itself. This page specific to CHIP (Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential). Clonal hematopoiesis refer to a population of related myeloid cells with an acquired gene mutation. It is a characteristic of myelodysplastic syndromes, but may also be found in some individuals who have no detectable hematologic malignancy, here it refers to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). There are four different kinds of clonal hematopoiesis: CHIP with driver mutation; CHIP with unkown drivers; chromosomal mosaicism; somatic loss of Y chromosome. Mosaicism is the possession of multiple genetically different cell lines in a single person that a person has 2 or more genetically different sets of cells in his or her body. A person with mosaicism may have some cells in his or her body with 46 chromosomes, but other cells have 47 chromosomes. It might be caused by an error in mitosis. Mitosis continues thoughout the lifetime and if there is an error that a cell does not split into 2 cells, the result is that some cells have the normal number of 46 chromosomes and other have more or fewer chromosomes.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[因为windows不能运行graph-tool库，所以了解了一下docker。我一开始的理解是类似于virtual machine, 但是了解了之后其实并不是这样，virtual machine 是指可以在一种操作系统里面运行另一种操作系统，但是virtual machine运行时会占用内存和硬盘，而且它是一个完整的系统，所以相对来说会感觉“臃肿”。 Linux开发了一种技术叫linux container，它不是一个完整的操作系统，在这个容器里面所有的进程都是虚拟的，而且它是底层系统的一个进程，这样速度就会快很多而且不会占用很多资源。 Docker的概念就是基于此，docker是linux container的一种封装， docker提供了一个接口， 把应用程序都放在一个image里，运行它就会生成一个container，程序就在这里面运行。 下面就是一个例子用docker安装graph-tool, 并且运行graph-tool。 install graph-tool using Docker 1&gt;docker pull tiagopeixoto/graph-tool run jupyter notebook inside the docker image 1234# /home/user is the virtual work directory&gt;docker run -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 -it -u user -w /home/user tiagopeixoto/graph-tool bash$ jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 check the container ID 1&gt;docker ps If you closed the terminal but did not stop the container, you could enter it again. 1&gt;docker exec -it [container ID] bash you can also copy the files in docker container to local directory 1&gt;docker container cp [container ID]:[work directory] [local directory]]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[Boolean Logic Regression Note]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F07%2F10%2FLogic-Regression%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In the regression models, we always only include the main effects and some simple interaction terms, which ignore many interactions especially when all the predictors are binary. This is the most important problem in the analysis of SNP microaray data. My master thesis is a kind of study trying to optimize this problem and validate a better approach through Iterative Sure Independence Screening developed by a mathematician, Jianqing Fan.Logic regression is a regression methodology that try to find combinations through Boolean logic of binary variables that highly predict the response. Boolean algebra is a kind of algebra that the variables values are either true or false, the operations of Boolean algebra are $\bigwedge (AND)$, $\bigvee (OR)$, $^{c} (NOT)$. The operations are the following: x \bigwedge y, if x=y=1, then x \bigwedge y=1, otherwise x \bigwedge y=0x \bigvee y, if x=y=0, then x \bigvee y=0, otherwise x \bigvee y=1x^{c}, if $x=1$, x^{c}=0The logic tree: The location of each element is a knot. The knots that do not have a parent is the root and the knots that do not have children are leaves.​ LOGIC MODELPaper reading: http://kooperberg.fhcrc.org/logic/documents/logic-regression.pdf Logic regression models: $g(E[Y])=\beta_{0} + \sum_{j=1}^{t} \beta_{j} L_{j}$, where $L_{j}$ is a Boolean expression of $X_{i}$ such like $L_{j}=X_{2} \bigwedge X_{3}$. Search for best models: movingAlternating a leaf: replace a leaf with another leaf at this position, the leaf cannot be replaced with its sibling or the complement of the sibling.Changing operators: replace $\bigwedge$ can be replaced with $bigvee$, also true for the reverse.Growing and pruning: the new branch can be grou and the counter move to grouing is pruning.Splitting and deleting: any leaf can be split by creating a sibling and any leaf can be deleted. Greedy SearchAs mentioned before, the regression model is built, a score function can be defined. For example, if linear regression, use RSS and if logistic model, use binomial deviance. The greedy algorithm is used to search best logic model, of which firstly is to find the single predictor that minimizes the score function. Then its neighbors(single move) are investigated, if a new state has a better score than the original then it will be chosen simulated annealingThe state space S is a collection of individual states and the states $S_{1}$,…,$S_{n}$ are related by a neighborhood system. The set of neighbor pairs in S defines a substructure M in S*S. The elements in M are moves, $(S,S’) \in M^{k}$ means two states S,S’ are connected via a set of k moves. All tress are fit simultaneously. We need preselect the maximum number t of trees, we select one tree in the logic model and then randomly pick a move from the move set, then refit the parameters for the new model and compare the score of the previous state and the new state, if the score is better, accept the move, if not, accept the move with a probability. model selectionTwo types of randomization tests. The first is an overall test for signal in the data. Assuming we first find the best scoring model, and we want to test whether there is association between X and Y. If there is no assocition, then Y are randomly permuted that it should have the same score as the best model. Repeat this procedure and the proportion of scores better than the best model as p value. The second is to determine the optimal model size. We want to test whether the better score obtained by models of larger sizes is due to noise. Assuming the optimal model has score $\epsilon_{j}$ and size j and sssuming the best scoring model has score $\epsilon’$ and size k. For a model with p trees, there can be up to $2^{p}$ fitted classes. Randomly permute the response, If the null hypothesis is true, the model size j is optimal, but other models of size j may have better score $\epsilon’’$ than $\epsilon_{j}$, then $\epsilon’$ would be a sample from the same distribution as $\epsilon’’$. Otherwise, optimal model had a size larger than j, then the randomization would have average worse scores than $\epsilon’$]]></content>

UCBIDefine upper and lower limit to represent where we believe true CTR(click-through rate) is. Using a Chernoff-Hoeffding bound, $\epsilon &gt; 0$, then $P(\hat{\mu} &gt; \mu + \epsilon) \leq exp(-2(\epsilon)^2 N)$ and the opposite site $P(\hat{\mu} &lt; \mu + \epsilon) \leq exp(-2(\epsilon)^2 N)$, which is equal to say $P(|\hat{\mu} - \mu| \leq \epsilon) &gt; 1-2exp(-2(\epsilon)^2 N)$. Therefore the probability of $\mu$ in an interval is larger than a function of the number of games.We choose the epsilon $\epsilon = \sqrt{\frac{2lnN}{N_j}}$, where N is the number of total games and $N_j$ is the number of games played in bandit j. Bayesian A/B Testing P(\theta | X)=\frac{P(X|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(X)}1.Conjugate Priors: If we choose beta distributions for $P(X|\theta)$ and $P(\theta)$, then we can make $P(\theta | X)$ have the same type of distribution as $P(\theta)$.Example: P(\theta | X)=Beta(a^{'},b^{'}) where $a^{‘}=a+\sum_{i=1}{N}x_{i}$ and $b^{‘}=b+N-\sum_{i=1}{N}x_{i}$. And the prior is beta(1,1), which is equal to uniform(0,1).123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657#%%#Bayesian A/B Testing simulationimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport numpy as npfrom scipy.stats import betaNUM_TRIALS = 2000#true click-through ratesBANDIT_PROBABILITIES =[0.2,0.5,0.75]class Bandit: def __init__(self,p): self.p=p self.a=1 self.b=1 def pull(self): #less than p, get 1 that if click-through rate is 0.2, random prob less than 0.2 will return 1 so 20% will return 1. return np.random.random()&lt;self.p def sample(self): return np.random.beta(self.a,self.b) def update(self,x): self.a+=x self.b+=1-xdef plot(bandits, trial): x=np.linspace(0,1,200) for b in bandits: y=beta.pdf(x,b.a,b.b) plt.plot(x,y,label=&quot;real p: %.4f&quot; % b.p) plt.title(&quot;Bandit distributions after %s trials&quot; % trial) plt.legend() plt.show()def experiment(): bandits = [Bandit(p) for p in BANDIT_PROBABILITIES] sample_points=[5,10,20,50,100,200,500,1000,1500,1999] for i in range(NUM_TRIALS): bestb=None maxsample=-1 allsamples=[] for b in bandits: sample=b.sample() allsamples.append(&quot;%.4f&quot; % sample) if sample &gt; maxsample: maxsample=sample bestb=b if i in sample_points: print(&quot;current samples: %s&quot; % (allsamples)) plot(bandits,i) x=bestb.pull() bestb.update(x)if __name__==&quot;__main__&quot;: experiment() Thompson Sampling ConvergenceAssuming the CTR $\theta$ of each bandit follows the distribution $beta((\alpha)_k, (\beta)_k)$.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Parallel processingReferences: https://github.com/berkeley-scf/parallelR-biostat-2015/blob/master/parallel.pdfcores: the different processing units on a single nodenodes: each like one computer, each with their own memoryprocess: tasks on a machinethreads: multiple paths of execution within a single processsockets: creating new R processes With shared memory, multiple processors share the same memory. With the distributed memory, many nodes and each node will run its own memory. Running on the cores of a single node using shared memory will be faster than using the same number of cores across multiple nodes. 1.futurefutureThe difficiency of R is that R has less API. But future is a good implementation of doing parallel computing in R.Future package can use a sequential strategy, which means it will run in the current R sessions. Other strategies can be used to run parallely on the current machine or on a cluster. During parallel working, the current R session does not block, and the future are being resolved in separate processes running in the background. The source of future is here: https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future/tree/master. The future package implements these types of work: 1.sequential: sequentially and run in the current R session2.multisession: multiple background R sessions on current machine. The package will launch a set of R sessions in the background. If all background sessions are busy serving other futures, the creation of the next multisession future is blocked until a backgoround session becomes available again. The total number of background processes is decided by the number of available cores on your machine.12availableCores()plan(multisession) 3.multicore: forking processes. Faster than multisession but unstable. For instance, when running R from within Rstudio process forking may resulting in crashed R sessions. The future package disables multicore by default. This will cause plan(multicore) to plan(sequential) and plan(multiprocess) to plan(multisession).123#default FALSEsupportsMulticore()plan(multicore) 4.multiprocess: multicore if supported otherwise multisession. Multisession will be used unless multicore evaluation is supported.12availableCores()plan(multiprocess) Global objects have to be passed exactly as they were at the time the future was created. future.applyfuture.apply is to parallelize the apply familyI will implement asynchronous futures:1234567library(future)#firstly check how many cores in your machineavailableCores()#this will actually run multisession using up to 20 parallel futures, also 20 cores.plan(multiprocess,workers=20)resuls &lt;- future.apply::future_lapply(1:10,function(x) createfunction(x)) 2.foreach and doParallelHow about another option of using foreach and doParallel packages? Inside the doParallel package, Pay attention to there are two types of parallel working, one is multicore functionality which runs tasks on a single computer, not a cluster of computers, and another is snow functionality. And pay attention to that the packages should be load within the foreach.

Assuming we have trained a regression tree $f_{k}$ on $X_{k}$ and $Y_{k}$ where k=1…K. Predictions of unknown samples $X_{unknown}$ are based on the average of the predictions from all the trees $f_{k}$ on $X_{unknown}$. f'=\frac {1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^{K} f_{k}X_{unknown}Or as for classification trees, based on the majority votes of trees. The optimal number of trees K can be found through cross-validation or by out of bag error. 2.Decision TreeA decision treee is a tree where each node represents a feature, each branch represents a dicision and each leaf represents an outcome. Tree models where the outcome are discrete values are called classification trees and tress models where the outcome take continuous values are called regression trees. 3.Random ForestRandom forest selects a random subset of the features at each candidate split in the learning process. If one or a few features are very strong predictors for the response variable, these features will be selected in many of the K trees, which cause them to become correlated.I will use the package in python and house price data in Kaggle as an implemention example. 4.Implementation1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526import pandas as pdimport numpy as npfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifierfrom sklearn import ensemble, tree, linear_modelfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score# read data intrain = pd.read_csv(&quot;D:/work/kaggle/train.csv&quot;)test = pd.read_csv(&quot;D:/work/kaggle/test.csv&quot;)# skip the procedures of data manipulation and cleaningdef train_test(estimator, x_trn, x_tst, y_trn, y_tst): prediction_train = estimator.predict(x_trn) # Printing estimator print(estimator) # Printing train scores get_score(prediction_train, y_trn) prediction_test = estimator.predict(x_tst) # Printing test scores print(&quot;Test&quot;) get_score(prediction_test, y_tst)RM = ensemble.RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=1000,random_state=0,criterion=&quot;mse&quot;,max_features=&quot;sqrt&quot;,max_depth=50).fit(x_train,y_train)train_test(RM,x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test) Boosting (Gradient Boosting)1.AlgorithmThe aim of the regression is to fit a model F(x) to predict the outcome $\hat{y}$ by minimizing the error. For example, in the situation of least-square regreesion setting, the aim of the regression is to fit a model F(x) to predict the outcome $\hat{y}$ by minimizing the mean squared error $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i}(\hat{y_{i}}-y_{i})^2$. At each stage k, $1 \leq k \leq K$, the function at each stage is $F_{k}$. The gradient boosting improves on the model by constructing a new model to estimate the error: $F_{k+1}(x)=F_{k}(x)+h(x)$. Assuming $\hat{y}=F(x)$ and the loss function is $L(y,\hat{y})$. The error for all samples are $J=\sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y_i,\hat{y_i}$. Based on the chapter of algebra basic, the gradient of J is $\nabla J=\hat{y} -y$. Therefore the algorithm of gradient boosting is:1.initialize a model $F_{0}(x)$2.For k=1 to K:2.1compute gradient r_{ki}=-\frac {\alpha L(y_{i}, F(x_{i}))}{\alpha F(x_{i})}2.2Fit a function $h_{k}$ by using the training dataset 2.3compute $\gamma$ by solving the below equation: \gamma_{k}=argmin \sum_{i=1}^{n}L(y_{i},F_{k-1}(x_{i})+\gamma h_{k}(x_{i}))2.4Update the model F_{k}(x)=F_{k-1}(x)+\gamma_{k}h_{k}(x)2.ImplementationI will use package in Python as an example. 12345from sklearn import ensemble, tree, linear_modelfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressorGBest = ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=3000, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=3, max_features=&apos;sqrt&apos;, min_samples_leaf=15, min_samples_split=10, loss=&apos;huber&apos;).fit(x_train, y_train)]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is the review and cheatsheet of some basic linear algebra knowledge during my undergraduate study. 1. BasicDeterminantA scalar value that can be computed from elements of a square matrix. det(A)=|A|=\sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{i+j}a_{i,j}M_{i,j}where $a_{ij}$ is the element of A and $M_{ij}$ is minor. Matrix InverseA square matrix M has an inverse that M is invertible if the determinant $|M| \neq 0$. A^{-1}A=IThe inverse properties are1.(A^{-1})^{-1}=A2.(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}3.(A^{-1})^{T}=(A^{T})^{-1} Orthogonal MatricesA square matrix $A \in R^{nn}$ is orthogonal: A^{T}A=I=AA^{T}Matrix multiplication\(A \in R^{mn}\) and \(B \in R^{np}\) C=AB=\sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{ik}B_{kj}Matrix transpose (A^{T})^T=A(AB)^{T}=B^{T}A^{T}(A+B)^{T}=A^{T}+B^{T}TraceThe trace of a square matrix $A \in R^{nn}$ is denoted as tr(A), which is the sum of diagonal elements in the matrix:$tr(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{ii}$. Properties are below:1.trA=trA^{T}2.tr(A+B)=trA+trB3.tr(tA)=t tr(A)4.tr(AB)=tr(BA)5.tr(ABC)=tr(BCA)=tr(CAB) RankThe column rank of a matrix $A \in R^{mn}$ is the size of the largest subset of columns of A that constitute a linearly independent set. The same definition as for row rank. For any matrix, the column rank is equal to the row rank. Both are denoted as rank(A). Properties are below:1.rank(A) \leq min(m,n)2.rank(A)=rank(A^{n}3.rank(AB) \leq min(rank(A), rank(B))4.rank(A+B) \leq rank(A)+rank(B) Eigenvalue and EigenvectorsGiven a square matrix A, \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue and x is the corresponding eigenvector if Ax=\lambda x, x \neq 0which equals to (\lambda I-A)x=0The properties are1.tr(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_{i}2.|A|=\prod{i=1}^n \lambda_{i}3.The rank of A is equal to the number of non-zero eigenvalues of A4.If A is non-singular then $1/\lambda_{i}$ is an eigenvalue of $A^{-1}$ with associated eigenvector.5.The eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix are just the diagonal entries. The gradient$f: R^{mn} \to R$ is a function that input a matrix A and returns a value. The gradient of f is the matrix of partial derivatives. \left[ \begin{matrix} \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{11}) & \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{12}) & ... \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{1n}) \\\\ \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{21}) & \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{22}) & ... \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{2n}) \\\\ ...... \\\\ \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{m1}) & \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{m2}) & ... \alpha f(A)/(\alpha A_{mn}) \\\\ \end{matrix} \right]2.Other definitions and calculationsLaplace Matrix (simple graph)Given a simple graph G with n vertices, its Laplace Matrix \(L_{nn}\) is defined as: L=D-A, where D is the degree matrix and A is the adjacency matrix. D is a diagonal matrix which includes the information about the degree of each vertex. A is the adjacency matrix which only includes 1 and 0 since G is a simple graph and the diagonal are all 0.symmetrix normalized laplacian L^{sym}=D^{-1/2}LD^{-1/2}=I-D^{-1/2}AD^{-1/2}Singular value decompositionAssume $A \in R^{mn}$ and all elements in M belongs to real or plural values. There exists a decomposition that A=U \sum V^{T}where U and V are orthogonal that $U^{T}U=I_{mm}$ and $V^{T}V=I_{nn}$. A^{T}A=V (\sum)^{T} \sum V^{T}AA^{T}=U \sum (\sum)^{T} U^{T}Eigen decomposition$A \in R^{nn}$ is a square matrix with n linear independent eigenvectors $q_{i}$(i=1…n). A can be factorized as A=Q\Lambda Q^{-1}where Q is the square n by n matrix with ith column is the eigenvector of A, and $\Lambda$ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Assuming there is a continuous outcome measure y, and the interest is to examine the relationship between y and a continuous variable called $x_{1}$ that the model is something like this $y~\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\epsilon$. And assuming we also have age and sex fixed effects in the model, so the model is like this $y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}age+\beta_{3}sex+\epsilon$. But the situation is that for each subject, we took multiple measures at different timepoints that each subject have multiple responses at different timepoints, so multiple responses from the same subject are not independent. We need to add random effect in the regression model to deal with this situation. Each subject might have different “baseline” y value that subject 1 might have a mean y value1 and subject 2 might have a mean y value2 across three timepoints. Therefore we need to include subjects as one random effect. $y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}x_{1}+\beta_{2}age+\beta_{3}sex+\gamma_{1}subject+\epsilon$]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Notes for the book: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation of Genome-Wide Association Scans Introduction:Charles Darwin’s workLed most directly to the field of genetics, which is the theory of evolution: 1) More individuals are produced each generation that survive. 2) Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable. 3) Those individuals with heriatble traits better suited to the environment will survive. 4) When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form [Wiki] Fundamental to the emergence of modern genetics was the discovery by Gregor Mendel:1) Law of Segregation: When sperm and egg unite at fertilization, each contributes its allele, restoring the paired condition in the offspring. 2) Law of Independent Assortment: Each pair of alleles segregates independently of the other pairs of alleles during gamete formation. 3) Law of Dominance: If the two alleles of an inherited pair differ, then one determines the organism’s appearance and is called the dominant allele. [Wiki] Organization of Chromosomes:22 autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes. The Centromere (which I circled in the example picture[Wiki]) divides the chromosome into two arms, the shorter arm is the p arm and the longer is the q arm. Example: 1q22 is the 2th band of the 2nd region of the long arm of chromosome 1. Organization of DNA:Each chromosome is made up of two strands of DNA, each strand has a deoxyribose backbone, each sugar having a 3’ carbon linked by a phosphate group to the 5’ carbon. The strand issue is the problem when compare SNP data from different genotyping platforms. If one platform uses probes for one strand and another platform uses the reverse probse, it will be read differently. So define “plus” or “forward” strand for a given chromosome as the strand of DNA for which the 5’ end is the nearest to the centromere, another definition is moving from the 5’ to the 3’ end moves in increasing base position order. The “minor” or “reverse” strand is the complementary strand to plus strand. Example in the picture: Types of Genetic Variation1) An SNV consists of a single base variation at a specific position on a given strand of DNA with the change measured relative to some existing consensus sequence. If an SNV presents at least 1%, it will be denoted as SNP.2) Insertions/Deletions3) Larger Structured Variants: including deletions, insertions, and duplications of segments of DNA that are 1kb or greater in extent are termed copy number variants or CNVs. Other types of structural variants include inversions and translocations.4) Exonic Variation: Mendelian traits are most often due to protein changes in specific genes.5) Non-exonic SNPs and Disease6) SNP Haplotypes: a combination of from several to many SNPs on the same chromosome segment of DNA. Basic Genomics:dbSNP: SNPs and other variants are reported.UCSC Genome Browser: tools and datasets compiling sequence information for many genome. The blat tool maps sequences to genome location and strand is also available?1000 Genomes Project website: Results of next generation sequencing of 1092 individuals from a variety of racial ethnic groups of similar diversity as HapMap phase 3. I use this datasets as a reference panel for imputation in GWAS study. My understandingHuman is diploid, 23 pairs of chromosomes, if both alleles of a human are the same, he is homozygous at that locus, otherwise it is heterozygous due to the existence of SNP. Assume on one loci of a chromosome, the base is T, normally if there is no polymorphism, it should also be T on the alleles because one from mother, one from father, if there is no SNP in the population, they should be same, but when there exists SNP, the genotype might be TC,TA,TG,CC,AA,GG. Quality Control Sample LevelFrom my own experience, it is very important to control the sample level, otherwise after you completing the whole GWAS, you will notice from the manhattan plot, some dots(variants) will suddenly jump to very abnormal level.1) IBD(Identity by Descent):]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Use ANNOVAR to annotate the SNPs. Prepare the ANNOVAR input file: vcf format or .avinput formatNotice: In vcf file, the reference allele column and alternative allele column is actually the major allele and minor allele, but major allele are not always the reference allele. So use R package to figure out the correct reference allele in hg19 at first. Example: 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758#Do the annotationsource(&quot;https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R&quot;)#biocLite(&quot;GenomicRanges&quot;)biocLite(&quot;BSgenome&quot;)biocLite(&quot;BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19&quot;)library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)#BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19#overviewgenome &lt;- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19seqlengths(genome)seqnames(genome)Hsapiens$chr2#read in significant snp information file#library(pegas)#vcf=read.vcf(&quot;sigsnpsvcf.vcf&quot;)snpinfo=read.table(&quot;sigsnps.bim&quot;,header = FALSE,sep=&quot;\t&quot;)colnames(snpinfo)=c(&quot;CHR&quot;,&quot;SNP&quot;,&quot;Unknown&quot;,&quot;BP&quot;,&quot;Minor&quot;,&quot;Major&quot;)#to get the reference allelechrs = seqnames(Hsapiens)[1:21]sigsnpref=c()k=1for (i in 1:21) &#123; for (j in k:(k+nrow(snpinfo[which(snpinfo$CHR==i),])-1) ) &#123; sigsnpref = c(sigsnpref,as.character(getSeq(Hsapiens, names=chrs[i], start=snpinfo[j,&quot;BP&quot;], end=snpinfo[j,&quot;BP&quot;]))) &#125; k=k+nrow(snpinfo[which(snpinfo$CHR==i),])&#125;sigsnpref.dat=data.frame(sigsnpref)snpinfo$ref=sigsnpref.dat$sigsnprefsnpinfo$Minor=as.character(snpinfo$Minor)snpinfo$Major=as.character(snpinfo$Major)snpinfo$ref=as.character(snpinfo$ref)#check unmatchsnpinfo[which((snpinfo$Major)!=(snpinfo$ref)),&quot;Minor&quot;]=snpinfo[which((snpinfo$Major)!=(snpinfo$ref)),&quot;Major&quot;]snpinfo$Major=snpinfo$refsnpinfo=snpinfo[,c(1:6)]write.table(snpinfo,&quot;sigsnps.bim&quot;,row.names = FALSE,col.names=FALSE,sep = &quot;\t&quot;,quote = FALSE)#prepare the .avinput file snpinfo$SNP=snpinfo$BPsnpinfo$Unknown=snpinfo$BPsnpinfo$Alt=snpinfo$Minorsnpinfo=snpinfo[,c(1,2,3,6,7)]colnames(snpinfo)=c(&quot;CHR&quot;,&quot;Start&quot;,&quot;End&quot;,&quot;Ref&quot;,&quot;Alt&quot;)write.table(snpinfo,&quot;sigsnps.avinput&quot;,row.names = FALSE,col.names=FALSE,sep = &quot;\t&quot;,quote = FALSE) #annotation=read.table(&quot;sigannotation5*10^-5.hg19_multianno.txt&quot;,header = TRUE,sep = &quot;\t&quot;, # c(&quot;Chr&quot;,&quot;Start&quot;,&quot;End&quot;,&quot;Ref&quot;,&quot;Alt&quot;,&quot;Func.refGene&quot;,&quot;Gene.refGene&quot;,&quot;GeneDetail.refGene&quot;,&quot;ExonicFunc.refGene&quot;,&quot;AAChange.refGene&quot;)) annotation=read.csv(&quot;sigannotation2.hg19_multianno.csv&quot;,header = TRUE) annotation$BP=annotation$Start colnames(annotation)[1]=&quot;CHR&quot; sigsnps=read.csv(&quot;unilog_4covs_ph.csv&quot;,header = TRUE) combine_annotation=merge(sigsnps,annotation,by.x=c(&quot;CHR&quot;,&quot;BP&quot;),by.y=c(&quot;CHR&quot;,&quot;BP&quot;),sort = FALSE) write.table(combine_annotation,&quot;result_table.csv&quot;,sep = &quot;,&quot;,row.names = FALSE,col.names = TRUE,quote = FALSE) use plink plink --bfile filename --recode vcf --out filename to convert to vcf format, then download the database 123456789annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb -webfrom annovar refGene humandb/annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb cytoBand humandb/annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb -webfrom annovar exac03 humandb/ annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb -webfrom annovar avsnp147 humandb/ annotate_variation.pl -buildver hg19 -downdb -webfrom annovar dbnsfp30a humandb/ Then using table_annovar.pl to annotate in one step: 123table_annovar.pl vcffile --buildver hg19 -out outfilename -remove -protocol refGene,cytoBand,exac03,avsnp147,dbnsfp30a -operation g,r,f,f,f -nastring . -vcfinputtable_annovar.pl .avinputfile -buildver hg19 -out outfilename -remove -protocol refGene,cytoBand,exac03,avsnp147,dbnsfp30a -operation g,r,f,f,f -nastring . -csvout -polish -xref gene_reffile If using annotate_variation.pl to apply only gene based annotation 1perl annotate_variation.pl --geneanno -dbtype refGene -out outfilename -build hg19 avinputfile directory_refgene]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[I did this project during my summer intern in 2017 at Duke. It was the first time I got the knowledge of Electronic Medical Record and ICD-9 codes. We focused on Duke Medical Center Electronic Medical Records from 2004 to 2013 of 210,329 patients with 10,804 unique ICD9 diagnosis codes records for each patient. The algorithm I used is the supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation(supvised topic model). The attached is the poster of this project. This browser does not support PDFs.
